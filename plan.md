# Day 1: Figma Design & Website Analysis Plan

## Objective
Analyze the existing SIT website and create a modern, responsive Figma design for desktop and mobile.

## Step 1: Analyze the Existing Website

  - **About Us:** Mission, history, leadership
  - **Academics:** Departments, courses, admission
  - **Campus Life:** Facilities, events, clubs
  - **Placements:** Recruiters, statistics
  - **Contact:** Map, contact form
- [ ] Sketch rough wireframes on paper or directly in Figma
- [ ] Focus on hierarchy: highlight important info

---

## Step 3: Start Figma Design
- [ ] Open Figma and create a new project file
- [ ] Set up artboards:
  - Desktop: 1440px
  - Tablet: 768px
  - Mobile: 375px
- [ ] Design header & navigation:
  - Logo on left
  - Menu on right
  - Sticky header

  - College name & tagline
  - Call-to-action buttons (Apply Now, Admissions)

---

## Step 4: Add Branding Elements

- [ ] Choose readable fonts (Roboto, Poppins, Open Sans)
- [ ] Add icons or illustrations for departments, facilities, achievements

---

## Step 5: Create Interactive Prototype (Optional)
- [ ] Link buttons to sections/pages
- [ ] Show dropdown menus, sliders, and forms
- [ ] Preview design in Figma prototype mode (desktop & mobile)

---

## Step 6: Review & Finalize
- [ ] Compare with the original site:
  - Clean layout?
  - Easier navigation?
  - Modern professional look?
- [ ] Make adjustments
- [ ] Export Figma assets (images, icons, logos) for Day 2 development
